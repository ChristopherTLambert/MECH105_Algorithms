# LU Factorization Algorithm

## Created By: Christopher Lambert

## Algorithm Explanation

### Goal 
Function returns L, U, and Pivot Matrix of a coeficient Matrix A. 

### Inputs
- A: Coeficient Matrix

### Outputs
- L: lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
- U: upper triangular matrix
- P: the pivot matrix

### Limitations
- Coeficient matrix has to be a square matrix meaning the number of rows has to equal the number of columns.
