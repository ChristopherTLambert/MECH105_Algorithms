# Linear Regression Rule Algorithm

## Created By: Christopher Lambert

## Algorithm Explanation

### Goal 
linear Regression Function Computes the linear regression of a data set

### Inputs
- x: x-values for our data set
- y: y-values for our data set

### Outputs
- fX: x-values with outliers removed
- fy: y-values with outliers removed
- slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
- intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
- Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination

### Limitations
- If all criterias are met there are no limitations.
