### Tips for navigating to Algorithms
Each alogorithm can be found in a folder within MECH105_Algorithms directory/folder. In the algorithm folder (named by the name of the algorithm) you can find the file of the algorithm used through MATLAB, as well as a README.md file that describes the algorithm: how it works, inputs/outputs, limitations, etc.
