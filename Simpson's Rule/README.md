# Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm

## Created By: Christopher Lambert

## Algorithm Explanation

### Goal 
A general MATLAB function for integrating experimental data using Simpsonâ€™s 1/3 rule

### Inputs
- The function numerically evaluates the integral of the vector of function values y with respect to x

### Outputs
- I: Integral of the function based on the polynomial fit of the points (x,y)

### Limitations
- General errors of simpson's 1/3 rule when calculating error. However, MATLAB script of the function has no limitations if all the criteria is met: for every x there is a y value.
